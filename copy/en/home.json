        "Dear Customers,",
        "Whilst planning the future of Bears Lairs Self Storage, we have come to understand that we are only in a position to continue to serve our customers if we increase prices to reflect the cost of maintaining our business. We all know that the cost of doing business everywhere has increased rather dramatically over recent tumultuous years and while we regret having to make this decision, it is actually the only feasible way we can continue to offer the storage facility and serve our customers going forward. Our own costs for maintenance, accounting, security and cctv alerting, bandwidth and storage have increased consistently in each year of operation but so far those costs have only been borne by the business without taking the form of customer price increases.",
        "Having said that, we are not in an imminent crisis and thankfully, we have time to introduce pricing changes in a way that we hope will allow all of our customers to make considered decisions on how to proceed going forward. Customers making payments in 2024 at their current subscription rates, will not see a price increase until their next payment (in 2025) becomes due. For example, if you normally pay annually on December 31st, your bill for 31/Dec/2024 to 31/Dec/2025, will still reflect your current price plan, without any price increase, for the whole of 2025. Additionally, if you choose to convert your monthly plan to an annual one before the end of 2024, you will continue to enjoy your current pricing, until that plan becomes due for renewal.",
        "Space at our facility has become rather scarce and in order to better serve the needs of our long term customers, we are discontinuing monthly payment plans. The majority of our customers make use of the facility for longer periods of time but the few who do not, often require higher levels of support in the short time they are with us. Most of our monthly subscribers have also communicated to us that monthly bills are difficult to keep track and stay on top of. For this reason, a three month stay and payment period, will be our minimum rental duration going forward.",
        "Whilst making these changes, we are also introducing a clear policy that all customers will enjoy transparency and clarity on what each storage solution costs. We are simplifying our approach and modifying prices for 2025 as follows:"
